    "Mobile technology has revolutionized how much of the world functions. It has the fastest growth of any technology in history (West, 2015). The speed of information that can be transferred across the globe has astronomically increased. Furthermore, the use of mobile technology has changed the relationship between businesses and consumers (West, 2015). The market for mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, has grown in tandem. A study conducted by the Pew Research Center concluded that around 90% of Americans currently have some form of mobile device (West, 2015). One primary component of mobile devices are the applications that are on the phone. They appear as bubble icons on the device’s display that are loaded by tapping on them. Application use is the primary way that users interact with their phones. A few applications are preloaded onto the phone. However, a significant number of applications must be downloaded from a host. For Apple phones, the Apple Store supplies nearly all of the applications that users can choose to download.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon the opening of the Apple Store, an “app economy” bloomed. The app economy is the development, marketing, and consumption of mobile applications (Dyer-Witheford, 2014). A significant portion of the software development field is dedicated towards the creation and maintenance of mobile applications (Dyer-Witheford, 2014). Due to the sheer scale of mobile applications, it is crucial for both companies and consumers to understand current trends in the app market. There is a huge spread of variability within the application market -- the type of application, such as social apps, games, or services; the price of the application; the company behind the development of the application; and the services that the application provides. Also, there are demographic trends for users of certain apps, such as age and gender, and statistical trends for products, like user ratings.  \n",
    "\n",
    "On the company's end, the pricing of apps is mainly driven by a desired end result. Whether a group is striving for user numbers or aiming to make large profits determines if an application is free or paid. However, these desired goals are balanced by what customers are willing to pay for the product which is influenced by perceived quality and level of necessity. If customer reviews are in favor of the product and listed features align with user needs, people are more likely to see it as worthwhile. Since there are an abundant number of free iOS apps, choosing to not make an application free automatically raises the users’ expectations that what they are paying for will be worth the extra dollars that another product may not be asking for. It is up to a company to ensure their app fulfills expectations which goes on to affect if an individual is willing to pay for something they have not been able to even use yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "User ratings are quite subjective and they encompass a variety of user profiles that conjunctively measure if the quality of a product is worth its monetary value. Ratings can be generally higher for paid apps as customers believe they are getting more and quality matches up to a price point. However, ratings can also be lower as high expectations can exceed what the app provides. General trends of iOS app ratings in relation to prices are largely influenced by the level of uncertainty users have when searching for a tool (Song, Kim, Jones, Baker, & Chin, 2014). This uncertainty, ranging from knowing exactly what is expected from the company’s products to needing an application as a first resource, influences expectations and demands which is reflected upon user app ratings. \n",
